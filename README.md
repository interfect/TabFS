# Novak TabFS Fork

This project is an attempt to make osnr's TabFS easier to install. It includes
the browser extension, and the C code that talks to it to present the
filesystem interface to the browser's internals. The extension ID has been
changed so as not to conflict with the upstream project.

See <https://omar.website/tabfs/> for the upstream project.

(**update**: You can now **[sponsor further development of
TabFS](https://github.com/sponsors/osnr)** and help to turn it from an
experiment into something really reliable and useful!)
