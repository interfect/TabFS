# Novak TabFS Fork

It's like `/sys` for your browser!

This add-on exposes as much of your browser's internal state as possible to other processes on your computer via the filesystem. It allows all other porcesses to see all information about the internal state of the browser (including the web addresses you are browsing to and images of the contents of your web pages), and to control the browser and the pages within it.

You can use this add-on to integrate your browser with your own command line tools and shell scripts as part of your personal workflow.

You **SHOULD NOT** use this add-on if you have **ANY** possibility of having programs you do not trust running on your computer. The add-on will provide them an easy way to get at the internals of your browser, without having to resort to serious hacker techniques like attaching a debugger to the process.
